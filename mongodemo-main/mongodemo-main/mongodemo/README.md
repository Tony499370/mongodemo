### MEN - MongoDB + Express + NodeJS

This example includes the codebase of a live application created in this lab. The codebase relies on NodeJS, which can be installed by following the instructions provided in the lab.

To install the necessary packages, navigate to the source code directory in the command prompt and run the command `npm install`. This will install all the dependencies required for the project.

> [!Note]
> Ensure to update the MongoDB Atlas connection string by copying it from your MongoDB Atlas account and pasting it in the `.env` file, assigning it to the `MDB_CONN_STR` variable.

Once the dependencies are installed, the server can be executed using the command `npm run start`. This will start the server in watch mode, allowing for hot reloading during development.
